PLUGIN SYSTEM:

A gPHPEdit plugin is a script that gPHPEdit will list in the menu and allow you to integrate somewhat with the editor. The files must be executable by the current user. There are a limited number of things a plugin will receive from gPHPEdit and a limited number of things it can return.

The plugins should be stored either in /usr/share/gphpedit/plugins/ if you want them to be available for all users on your machine or in ~/.gphpedit/plugins/ if you only want them to be available for the current user.

The number of plugins available is limited to 30. User specific plugins take preference over global plugins if the number is over 30.
The menu will asign automatically a shortcut to the first 10 plugins. [CONTROL + number]
Syntax plugins aren't shown in plugins menu, because they are incorporate to the syntax check system. When you run the syntax check, they will be automatically run.
How it works
The general mechanism for interacting with a plugin is as follows:


* gPHPEdit will ask for plugin information with the following command line parameters and the result must be print to stdout
* This is run while setting up the plugin
** -name : return plugin name.
** -desc : return plugin description
** -icon : return plugin icon name
** -copyright : return plugin copyright info.
** -website : return plugin website.
** -version : return plugin version.
** -authors : return plugin authors. must be a null terminated string with names using ',' as separator.
** -type :
* Your plugin must print one of the following types to STDOUT:
  o SELECTION - your plugin requires the current selection of text or nothing if none is selected
  o NO-INPUT - your plugin doesn't require anything
  o FNAME - your plugin requires the current full filename (local files only)
  o SYNTAX - like FNAME but will act as a syntax checker. (if no default check are present can be run by press F9)
    * Syntax plugins must return the file tipe when run with a command line parameter of -ftype
      ** languages supported:
        *** PHP
        *** HTML
        *** XML
        *** C
        *** C++
        *** C/C++
        *** COBOL
        *** SQL
        *** PERL
        *** PYTHON
* When the menu item is clicked, gPHPEdit runs your plugin with either the selection or the filename in single quotes according to the type mentioned.
* Your plugin must then print to STDOUT one of the following actions:
  o INSERT - your plugin requires that the gPHPEdit inserts the text that is about to be returned at the cursor position (i.e. after any current selection)
  o REPLACE - your plugin requires that the gPHPEdit replaces any current selection with the text that is about to be returned
  o OPEN - your plugin requires that gPHPEdit opens the file that is about to be specified (NB: this can be the same as the file specified inwards with FNAME, this will reload the current file)
  o MESSAGE - your plugin requires that the gPHPEdit show an info dialog
  o SYNTAX - your plugin requires that the gPHPEdit process syntax check output, show it in syntax pane and apply style to text
    ** output must have the following struct line number space message dot like next example:
    ** 59 invalid operator.\n
    ** lines end with \n 
* The next thing your plugin must print is a newline character
* Finally your editor should print either the content or the filename, then close
